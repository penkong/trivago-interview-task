In her brand new stand-up hour, MAE MARTIN looks at the uphill battle of trying to do the right thing in a world that sometimes seems to have lost its moral compass. With her characteristically manic self-reflection, she bounces between vice and virtue, optimism and pessimism, the urge to be our best selves versus the urge to gleefully give in to our more base instincts. But it’s not all big questions – there’s also a lot about sloths, moose, hot dogs, love, and tree sap. Along with her new Channel Four and Netflix sitcom Feel Good, Mae is a multi award winning stand-up, who’s also released two radio series for BBC Radio Four, and written the acclaimed book Can Everyone Please Calm Down? A Guide to 21st Century Sexuality.;

Having triumphed in their Semi-Final heat with over 63% of the votes, they then won the overall competition with one of the biggest majorities ever. This subsequently led to them joining Simon Cowell’s label Syco, and hence becoming label-mates with the likes of One Direction, Little Mix, Susan Boyle and Il Divo. In the three years since the competition, Collabro have released a Number 1 debut album “Stars”, followed by “Act Two” which peaked at Number 2 in the charts in the summer of 2015. They have performed at the Royal Variety Performance; twice on Britain’s Got Talent (most recently the 10-year Grand Final compilation of past contestants – having been voted ‘The Nation’s Favourite BGT Winner’ in a national poll) and are now enormously successful internationally. Notably, they have performed for over 30 million people in Japan on Music Station on two separate occasions – receiving a Gold Disc for Best International Artist alongside Sam Smith and Meghan Trainor. They have also completed two tours of America and signed a major US record deal. The boys performed to 7 million people at Soccer Aid 2016 to critical praise and garnered excellent press reviews for their first performance as a four-piece followed by a performance at the 2016 BBC Proms in the Park. A Summer Tour supporting the legendary Cliff Richard preceded their own sell-out 29 date Headline Tour of the UK at the end of 2017. March 2017 saw the release of their highly anticipated third studio album -‘Home’- a collection of stage classics, fan favourites and also their first original song ‘Lighthouse’, reaching Number 7 in the UK Album Chart.

Whilst the Daily Telegraph rightly described them as being at the top of the tribute band tree, the journey has been a long one and began in 1988 in Adelaide. Lee Smith, a local guitarist obsessed with Pink Floyd, and needing to augment his band [featuring drummer Grant Ross and bassist Trevor Turton] placed an ad in Allans Music store. It read: Vocalist and Keyboardist required for band. Professional attitude expected. We only play Pink Floyd. Steve Mac and Jason Sawford each saw the ad and soon the now five-piece band commenced regular weekly practice. Whilst learning and practicing the songs they constantly referred to Lee's extensive collection of Pink Floyd albums and bootleg recordings. They also started to create the sounds necessary to perform Pink Floyd correctly, and this became, and still is, one of the most important aspects of the band. The first live show was performed to a select group of family and friends including Richard Guest and Greg 'Bear' Sutton, both of whom would serve time in the bands road crew. Having settled on the name Think Floyd, the quintet soon secured their first paying gig at the Alma Hotel. More gigs followed. the band banking $600AU for a show at the Tivoli witnessed by Colin Wilson who would later join the band. Though the reaction was positive, it seemed hard to find a regular audience, and the line-up drifted apart, until 1992 saw a refocusing and a redoubling of efforts. Peter Whitely replaced Trevor Turton and the band aimed for bigger and better, often using a quadraphonic sound system that they ended up lugging to venues themselves. 92 saw the band back on track, but also their first big break. On a trip to theUK to visit family, Steve Mac made contact with the publishers of 'Brain Damage' magazine, the biggest Pink Floyd fanzine at that time. Glenn Povey, the owner of the magazine was planning a Pink Floyd fan convention at Wembley in August 93, and decided that 'Think Floyd' should perform. In order to raise money for the trip, the band began gigging furiously in Australia, clocking up serious miles but honing what they did ever more. Colin Wilson was drafted in to replace Peter Whitely who could not make the trip to the UK. The five band members plus long time 'roadies' Richard Guest and 'Bear' Sutton, boarded their BA flight to Heathrow on August 8, 1993. Upon arrival, British customs impounded all their equipment! Not a good start but everything was back on track for the warm up show on Friday 13th... The band by this time had changed their name to 'The Australian Pink Floyd Show'. At the convention TAPFS put on a three hour spectacular that is talked about to this day. Glenn Povey was so enthused that he started booking the band more shows, and would continue to do so for three years. 93 had been an incredible year but it ended with the departure of homesick founder Lee Smith, and also Bear Sutton. By the time the band performed at Belfasts The Limelight in January 1994, Damian Darlington had come in to fill the gap. The audience for the band was beginning to grow - not just in the UK but also in Europe - but in September 94 came a show that changed everything. David Gilmour visited the band backstage after a show in Croydon - pointing out that hed never had the chance to see Pink Floyd perform. He was very complimentary, posed for pictures and invited the band to perform at Pink Floyd's party to mark the end of their Division Bell tour. Due to curfew restraints at the venue, this plan fell through but, when the phone rang not long after, the band found themselves asked to perform a handpicked set at an event marking Gilmours 50th birthday. The Australian Pink Floyd Show topped the bill at the evenings festivities at theFulhamTown Hall, performing Pink Floyd to the members of Pink Floyd amongst others. Toward the end of the performance Pink Floyd bassist Guy Pratt joined the band on stage along with Rick Wright for a rendition of 'Comfortably Numb'. This was followed by David Gilmour, Gary Wallis, Tim Renwick and Claudia Fontaine along with Guy and Rick, performing a number of edited versions of Floyd songs including 'Money' and 'What Do You Want From Me'. It was an incredible ending to an unbelievable night. Following that was always going to be hard, but it gave the band impetus to push forward even harder and deliver amazing shows for their fans. In 1997, the band performed a show at Battersea Power Station - the iconic building known to all Pink Floyd fans as the 'Animals' album cover, and the scene of the famous floating pig. The Australian Pink Floyd Shows similar image of a floating kangaroo had been used to promote the band since the early days. 1998 saw the band perform at Glastonbury Festival. In 2003, the band were faced with a choice: to keep doing the same as they had for the past 10 years, or to step up a gear. TAPFS made a big decision and embarked on their most ambitious period to date. 2003 was the 30th anniversary of Pink Floyds landmark album 'The Darkside of the Moon'; there was no better time for TAPFS to perform this album in its entirety. Backing vocalists and saxophone were added to the line up and new improved animations were produced by American animator, Bryan Kolupski for the new circular screen. The band toured 'TDSOTM' throughout 2003 and into 2004, taking the whole show to North America for their first full tour, and continuing in Europe. Everywhere the band played they received incredible reviews and it seemed the world had now fully embraced TAPFS. Continuing to wow the crowds globally, TAPFS have constantly striven to seek out new audiences and turn in jaw-dropping performances to reconnect people with the music that they love. It is still all about the music - Pink Floyd - and delivering the absolute best performance each and every night.";

Initially inspired by the unprecedented reaction to his performance of David Bowie’s Life On Mars on BBC Radio 2 in early 2016, Piano Portraits features instrumental versions of hits Rick originally performed on (Space Oddity, Morning Has Broken & Wondrous Stories) as well of others specifically chosen for their wonderful melodies, including Stairway To Heaven, Help and Eleanor Rigby. He has also added a selection of some of his favourite classical pieces (Berceuse, Clair de Lune and Swan Lake). The show will include at least eight of the pieces on the album, plus other musical surprises, and all will be interspersed with hilarious anecdotes from this well-known and accomplished raconteur. Rick’s one man shows are extremely popular and consistently sell out – a trend that looks likely to continue with the success of Piano Portraits. Please note there is a £2 ticket commission fee included in the price of the ticket.;0131 668 2019

It’s also a grown-up record. ’10 Songs’ is a record about the way life comes at love and what love does to weather those challenges. “This is no rehearsal/This is the take,” sings Fran at the beginning of Waving At The Window, over an insistent piano hook, “Promises you once kept/Are going to break Every track on this album carries an even load. No passengers here. Nowhere to hide. “I write songs in an antiquated way,” explains their creator, “Sitting at the bottom of the bed, ‘pouring my simple sorrow to the sound hole and my knee’, as Joni Mitchell put it.” As a songwriter based in L.A., Fran Healy doesn’t need anyone to tell him this is no longer how it’s done. It’s far from uncommon for the credits on successful modern pop songs to feature upwards of ten writers. “It’s fine,” notes Fran, “Personally though, I’ll take ten songs written by one person over one song written by ten people. And if I feel that way, then surely someone else must do too.”";

Not many artists can say they premiered a classical nocturne and had a Grammy-nominated rap song with Kanye West (“Do What You Gotta Do” on “Famous”) in the same year, but Jimmy’s career is full of surprises. Since his first platinum hit “The Worst That Could Happen”, Webb has had numerous hits including “Up, Up and Away”, “By the Time I Get to Phoenix”, “Wichita Lineman”, “Galveston”, “All I Know” and “MacArthur Park” and has also become a leader and mentor in the industry as a champion for songwriters. Webb is the only artist ever to have received Grammy Awards for music, lyrics and orchestration. His numerous accolades include the Academy of Country Music’s Poet Award (2016) and the prestigious Ivor Novella International Award (2012). In 2016, Rolling Stone listed Webb as one of the top 50 songwriters of all time. Jimmy Webb was the youngest person ever inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Led by co-founder Graham Gouldman, the art-pop band are heralded in equal measure for their ability to craft ingenious songs that also resonated commercially, with eleven top 10 hits, and over 15 million albums sold in the UK alone. The group also have three No 1 singles to their name – Rubber Bullets, Dreadlock Holiday and I’m Not In Love. The line-up features Gouldman (bass, guitar, vocals), Rick Fenn (lead guitar, bass, vocals), Paul Burgess (drums, percussion) – both of whom have been with the band since the mid-’70s - Keith Hayman (keyboards, guitars, bass, vocals) and Paul Canning (vocals, percussion, guitar, keyboards). Since the most recent live version of the band has been established, 10cc have toured worldwide, including Australia, Japan, Iceland, New Zealand, across the UK and Europe. They’ve performed at the British Summer Time festival in Hyde Park, and sold out London’s 5200 seat Royal Albert Hall in advance last year. It has been an eventful few years for Graham Gouldman. Not only is 10cc enjoying increasing success around the world, but recognition of his solo achievements has grown too. Being invited by Ringo Starr to join his All Starr Band for tours of Europe in June 2018 and the USA that September, during which the band played three 10cc songs, elevated his profile yet further. 2020 is set to be another sell out year as the band take their inspirational live show back on the road, performing their timeless hits and more, and always with a surprise or two.;

In the face of these successes, the band members decided to put themselves to the ultimate test for the creation of their third full-length, Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea: they took a year off from touring and focused all their energy on songwriting. Holed up in their rehearsal space, dubbed The Practice House, which in actuality is a rundown farmhouse, the quartet—vocalist Chris Robertson, guitarist Ben Wells, bassist Jon Lawhon and drummer John Fred Young—crafted almost 50 songs of soaring, Southern-fried hard rock about everything from being proud of where you come from and true to who you are, on lead single “White Trash Millionaire,” to songs like the rip roaring “Blame It On The Boom Boom,” that will make you want to jump up and shake what your mama gave ya. The album that Black Stone Cherry emerged with is a blistering set of intoxicating anthems, much like a modern version of their heroes in Lynyrd Skynyrd or the Marshall Tucker Band, whose 1975 country-rock classic “Can’t You See” has been revamped by the band for this go ’round. They poured everything they could into building the strongest hooks and the most passionate lyrics, both of which come through stunningly in songs like “Won’t Let Go” and “Like I Roll.” And they found inspiration in the pictures of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Cream, Howlin’ Wolf, and Muddy Waters that Young’s dad, Richard Young, and uncle, Fred Young—founding members of classic country rockers the Kentucky Headhunters—pinned to the walls of The Practice House when they formed the band as teenagers over a decade ago. For as hard as Black Stone Cherry worked, the most difficult part was taking off a year from touring. “This past year was the longest break from touring that we’ve ever taken, since forming the band,” Wells says. “Being in one place for so long was something we had to readjust to, but looking back, it gave us a chance to reflect, re-bond as brothers and craft the best songs we absolutely could.” Young adds, “It took being home with all these great people we love to create kick ass rock n roll like we do!” Armed with an impressive arsenal of tracks, Black Stone Cherry pulled off another first-time personal feat: they recorded Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea (an Old English euphemism for choosing between two undesirable situations) thousands of miles from home, in Los Angeles. Under the friendly watch of producer extraordinaire Howard Benson (Theory of a Deadman, Daughtry, Three Days Grace), the bandmates tightened up their oeuvre in the studio. In fact, being on the opposite coast with Benson was how “In My Blood” came about. The song is a heartfelt auto-biographical tale about being drawn to living life on the road, despite missing family and friends. “Howard said he was missing one more song from us, one that came from our hearts,” Wells says. “We sat at his house and he just pulled it out of us. We wrote it in 20 minutes.” During the recording of the album, Benson guided them to play nontraditional instruments like mandolins, banjos and drums bought from an old high school marching band. Between The Devil And The Deep Blue Sea is chocked full of well-crafted tales that give listeners a glimpse into life as Black Stone Cherry know it and live it. “I owned a 1981 Smokey and the Bandit Trans-Am that I drove around in primer paint when we wrote ‘White Trash Millionaire’,” Robertson says. “I spent countless hours working on it at the garage. We don’t need mansions or expensive sports cars to be content in life.” Moreover, Lawhon adds that they wrote the line about “the couch on the front porch,” because the house where they rehearse literally has a sofa on the front porch. “Of course the cushions don’t match,” he adds. Another song that shows off the group’s affinity for celebrating the simple things in life is “Like I Roll.” A song that could mean as much to a trucker driving an 18-wheeler in a convoy as it could to a rock band on a world tour as it recalls the free spirited life of living on the road. “The song is a reminder that no matter what you have to do, do it your way,” Robertson says. “And if no one supports you, at least you took that opportunity.” Wells says, “It’s about people who travel from city to city and love every single minute of it. It’s the life we live when we’re on the road.” Other standouts on the album include the emotional “Won’t Let Go” that really shows the strength in Robertson’s vocals. “The lyrics were pouring out of us because we could all relate to them,” Robertson says. “No matter where we go, we’re not going to let go of who we are and where we come from.” Showing their powerful vision, the band’s cover of “Can’t You See” sounds as if it were actually written by Black Stone Cherry, thanks to some thick guitars and more forceful melodies. “Blame It on the Boom Boom,” which has a fist-pumping chorus, is a party rocker par excellence, custom-built for sporting events and jukeboxes alike. Young expounds: “Blame it on the Boom Boom"" is about anything you want! Whatever gets you in trouble is the Boom Boom!” If anything, the album presents an even keel between Black Stone Cherry’s most memorable bangers and their most introspective songs. What’s clear, when the band looks back on the hard work they put into making the record, is that the time off was worth taking. It was a long process, but Black Stone Cherry’s Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea is one of the most well-rounded hard rock releases to come out of the last ten years.";

There’s the time he first held their debut single, Electricity, on Factory Records. There was the first of their staggering 29 Top Of The Pops appearances, when the Wirral electronic giants-to-be were initially so surprised to find themselves on the telly alongside Elton John and Bonnie Langford he mouthed “What are we doing here?!” at synth-playing OMD partner Paul Humphreys. Then there was signing his ever autograph at Liverpool Eric’s; being paid by the venue for the first time (with half a crate of beer), or standing on stage at the Rewind festival in 2018 with “35,000 people going wild”. Meanwhile, Paul whittles his highpoints down to two most significant achievements: meeting Tony Wilson, who told them he wanted to put out a record, and “every gig now, because it’s such a thrill that we’re still doing it”. However, the pair would be more than entitled to add their triumphant gigs with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, the Liverpool’s British Music Experience exhibition dedicated to their impressive legacy as well as their 2019 sell-out UK tour. Four decades has seen – give or take a decade break - Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark sell an astonishing 25 million singles and 15 million albums, establishing them as electronic synthesiser pioneers and one of Britain’s best-loved pop groups. Their 13 long players include benchmark-raising classics Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark (1980), Organisation (1980), Architecture & Morality (1981) and Dazzle Ships (1983). Three more since their reactivation 12 years ago have culminated in 2017’s The Punishment Of Luxury, which was hailed by fans and critics alike as a return to the shimmering brilliance of classic early singles such as nuclear lament Enola Gay and the plangent Souvenir. Their incredible career and 40th anniversary was celebrated last year with the release of a momentous anniversary box-set and critically-acclaimed world tour. OMD always had a sense of semi-classical grandeur, and the nuances of their music demonstrate how, for all their hits, they have simultaneously remained uncompromising and innovative over successive decades. Once upon a time, Factory boss Wilson told the two teenage Kraftwerk fans, “You are the future of pop music”, and indeed sounds and production techniques which OMD were using way back in 1980 have become part of the fabric of how today’s pop is made. But while OMD can rightly take their place in the lineage of electronic pop pioneers that stretches from Kraftwerk to Gary Numan, from the Human League to, much later Underworld and Orbital – and a key influence on current acts from the xx to Chvrches - there was always a warmth and wistful emotional quality to their songs that has consistently made them different. As Paul Humphreys explains, “There’s a certain melancholy beauty and romance about the west Wirral where we grew up, staring out at the estuary and the birds. The title Architecture and Morality was about us. The Architecture was the brutal structure of the electronics and the Morality was the emotion and the beauty. We’ve always wanted to bring humanity to our electronic music.” Perhaps none of this would have happened had the young McCluskey not heard Kraftwerk’s Autobahn On Radio One, and gone to see the German electronic Godfathers at the Liverpool Empire, sitting in seat Q36. This being 1975, the future pop star was clad in the slightly prog rocky fashions of the time: trench coat, loon pants, with a giant afro. “Then these guys walked out in suits and ties and I thought, ‘Oh my God.’ Nobody looked like that. No long hair. They were the antithesis of a rock band. They were melodic and musical but everything about them was not conforming.” The youngster was entranced. Andy and young pal Paul penned future classic songs Electricity and Julia’s song in Wirral five-piece The Id, a band with a guitarist and drummer, but when other members left, they seized their chance to become a two-piece. The pioneering electronic pop group of their dreams consisted of Andy (vocals, bass), Paul (synths) on bass and “Winston” (a reel-to-reel tape machine, instead of a drummer.) Their first gig – in October, 1978, supporting a comedian at Eric’s - was actually a dare, after Andy bravely knocked on the door and asked if they could play. Given four hours to come up with a name for the poster, they racked their list of potential song titles and wisely chose Orchestral Manouevres In The Dark instead of Margaret Thatcher’s Afterbirth. A reciprocal arrangement between Eric’s and the Factory club in Manchester meant that OMD played the club associated with the label home of Joy Division and Andy handed Tony Wilson a cassette of songs. Initially, the Factory boss was unimpressed, but wife Lindsay kept playing Electricity in the car, pleading, “This is the sort of thing you should be signing.” Andy chuckles: “So he went from saying ‘Oh yeah, bunch of long-haired Scousers’ to ‘You are the future of pop’!” To be fair, at this point OMD they didn’t look like future anything. Andy had taken to wearing a dinner jacket and braces and Paul sported loon pants and a moustache. Fatefully again, Factory designer Peter Saville (whose iconic sleeves would house their classic early albums) informed the pair, ‘Your music is the future but you look like the past. You’ve got to change your image and get your hair cut.” OMD complied, adopting a look – Kraftwerk-meets-suburban bank clerks – that was anti-fashion more than fashionable. As Andy puts it: “We wanted the focus to be on the music.” So it proved. OMD saw themselves as an conceptual art project, Wilson heard a pop group. Almost by accident, the pair realised they had an uncanny knack of writing pop tunes. Andy suspects that a childhood spent watching T. Rex and Slade on Top Of The Pops had left an imprint. “But we’ve always wanted to sugar coat our experiments to give people a reason to return to them,” observes Paul, noting the ingredient that made their music timeless. After signing to Virgin subsidiary Dindisc, for the first half of the Eighties, OMD were barely out of the charts, as songs such as Joan Of Arc and Maid Of Orleans led to a period where McCluskey’s awkward but weirdly hypnotically twitchy dancing became a Top Of The Pops fixture. As Andy puts it, “We took alternative music into the front rooms of every house in Britain”. 1983’s Dazzle Ships - a leftfield shift but also a Top 5 album featuring hit singles Telegraph and Genetic Engineering – is now regarded as an experimental classic, and constant tours led to them becoming a quartet and compelling live act (retiring Winston, who now takes his place in history alongside other OMD artefacts in the Museum of Liverpool). But by the end of the decade, though, OMD were tired, running dry on inspiration, “broken” by endless touring in America and – owing to a bad record deal signed when they were young – a million pounds in debt to the record label despite selling multi-millions of records. Andy vividly remembers the accountant telling them, “Lads, you’re skint.” Paul plunged himself into other projects, such as working with Propaganda singer Claudia Brücken. Andy made Sugar Tax (1991) as a solo OMD, although Paul contributed to the singles Everyday (on 1993’s Liberator) and two tracks on 1996’s Universal. That album’s Walking On The Milky Way, as fine a song as Andy has ever written, returned the OMD name to the Top 20 singles chart for the first time in five years. But as the 90s were dominated by grunge and Britpop, Paul remembers thinking, “All of a sudden, electronic music wasn’t the future, it was the past”. In a dramatic change of direction Andy created and wrote for girl group Atomic Kitten whose single Whole Again gave him his first British number one and 30th Top Of The Pops. Then, in 2006, came another quirk of fate. A TV show in Germany – where Maid Of Orleans is one of the biggest-selling singles ever – asked them to perform it. “And all these fans came to meet us at the hotel,” Andy remembers. “We thought, ‘This is weird. People are still interested. In the bar on the second night I said, ‘Someone’s paid for us to come here. We’re in this swish hotel drinking beer. Do you fancy doing this again? And we did.” They’ve barely looked back since. Despite initially reforming to play old material, that was never going to be enough for such a forward-looking band. History Of Modern (2010), English Electric (2013) and especially The Punishment Of Luxury (2017) have reignited their creativity and contemporary place in pop. “We were on a roll when we were making that album,” Paul says of the latter. “You can hear our joy in the music.” 2018 saw the re-release of the first four classic albums on heavyweight 180g vinyl, whilst 2019 saw the release of their 40th anniversary ‘Souvenir’ box set and greatest hits collection. In today’s OMD, Stuart Kershaw (who has worked with the band in various capacities since 1991) replaces long-time drummer Malcolm Holmes, alongside keyboardist/saxophonist Martin Cooper, but throughout their 40 years of OMD, founders Andy and Paul have retained and rekindled the friendship that blossomed as teenagers, and the inspiration that strikes when they’re together. “Electronic music is our language,” Andy says. “It’s how we talk.” “We’re at our best when we’re in a room together, working,” Paul adds. “That’s when the sparks and ideas happen. It’s the same now as it ever was.” Here’s to another 40 years.";

A native of Hemel Hempstead in England, Wilson was first exposed to music at the age of eight, when he started hearing his father listening to Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon,"" and his mother to Donna Summer's ""Love to Love You Baby,"" two albums that were pivotal in the development of his musical direction. His father, an electrical engineer, built him a multi-track tape machine, and he began to experiment with overdubbing and developing a repertoire of production techniques. Early demo tapes started to emerge in the mid 80's while Steven was still at school, and at the end of the decade he created the two projects which gained him entry to the professional music world: Porcupine Tree and No Man. Porcupine Tree, which explored psychedlia, progressive music, and his love of ambitious seventies music, was initially an imaginary ""band"" which, in reality, Steven overdubbed all the instruments himself. This even extended to early demo tapes coming with a fictional written history of the band, and biographical info about the fictitious performers. Around the same time, Steven formed No-Man, his long-term collaboration with singer Tim Bowness. Influenced by everything from ambient music to hip-hop, their early singles and albums were a mixture of dance beats and lush orchestrations. Signing to One Little Indian in the UK, and Epic in the US in 1990, they received tremendous accolades from the music press, with Singles Of The Week in Melody Maker, Sounds and Hot Press. Meanwhile, things progressed with Porcupine Tree, whose increasing popularity was fast outpacing the imaginary pretext of an actual group. The second full-length album, Up the Downstair was released in 1993 and was praised by Melody Maker as ""a psychedelic masterpiece... one of the albums of the year."" This was the first album to include keyboardist Richard Barbieri and bassist Colin Edwin. Towards the end of the year, Porcupine Tree became a real band for the first time with the inclusion of Chris Maitland on drums, and began to tour. Further albums throughout the late nineties, and extensive touring resulted in a string of indie chart placings and critical acclaim, many fans hailing them as the Pink Floyd of the nineties. In 2001 Porcupine Tree was signed to US label Lava Records, under the auspices of Atlantic Records. Now with the support of a major label, and featuring new drummer Gavin Harrison, In Absentia saw the light of day in 2002, featuring a heavier sound than all the group's previous works. It charted in many European countries and remains one of the top-selling Porcupine Tree albums. It was also their first album to be released in 5.1 Surround Sound,, and won the ""Best Made-For-Surround Title"" award for the Surround Music Awards 2004. Its 2005 follow-up, Deadwing was inspired by a film script written by Steven and film-maker Mike Bennion, and became the first Porcupine Tree album to chart the Billboard 200, entering at #132. The album won ""Album of the Year"" at the Classic Rock magazine awards, and its surround version received the ""Best Made-For-Surround Title"" once again. In 2006, Porcupine Tree released their first live DVD, titled Arriving Somewhere . The following year the band released Fear of a Blank Planet, its most successful selling album to date, receiving the most favorable reviews of the band's career. It entered the Billboard 200 at #59, and charted in almost all European countries, peaking at #31 in the UK. It was nominated for a US Grammy, and won several polls as the best album of the year. 2007 ended with the band playing their first arena shows, and their status as arguably the biggest ""underground"" band in the world was cemented. Steven has become known for the high standard of his production and is a sought-after mixer and producer. Artists he has worked with in this capacity include the Norwegian artist Anja Garbarek, Yoko Ono, and Swedish progressive-metal band Opeth for whom he produced three albums. More recently Wilson has become known for his 5.1 Surround Sound mixes - the 2007 Porcupine Tree album Fear of a Blank Planet and their 2009 followup The Incident were nominated for Grammys in the ""Best Mix For Surround Sound"" category. Fear of a Blank Planet was also voted by Sound And Vision, the second best 5.1 recording of all time. Steven is now working on several other surround sound projects, including remixing the King Crimson back catalogue. Other projects include Blackfield, a collaboration with Israeli megastar Aviv Geffen which has now produced three acclaimed albums, and Steven's drone / ambient / experimental outlet Bass Communion. In 2003 Wilson quietly started to release music under his own name for the first time, in the form of a series of two track CD singles on his own label Headphone Dust, each one featuring a cover version and an original SW song. The choice and treatment of the cover versions was unpredictable, with the first five featuring songs by Alanis Morissette, Abba, The Cure, Momus, and Prince. Stylistically these cover versions allowed Wilson to expand his musical pallete into everything from electronica, noise music, and stripped down acoustic balladry. This led to his decision to record his first solo album of original music. Between January and August of 2008, Steven began recording material that would comprise Insurgentes. Comprising 10 new tracks that range from ballads and anthems to all-out industrial noise assaults, the dark, cinematic, and richly textured disc represents two years' worth of creative output and numerous recording sessions worldwide in studios from Mexico City to Japan to Israel. The whole process was visually documented by film-maker Lasse Hoile, and 2010 film Insurgentes features footage of the recording sessions, surreal sequences, and interviews with Wilson and many other musicians about what it means to be a musician in the age of iPods and download culture. Now Wilson has set yet another benchmark for both musical composition and audio fidelitiy with his new album, Grace For Drowning, the second album released under his own name. Allowing his creative muse full license, Wilson has crafted 83 minutes of music that reflect his artistic sensibilities more fully than anything he's released before. Pop, industrial, electronica, drone, jazz, and prog merge seamlessly in everything from 4-minute ballads to long-form pieces rich with improvisation and time changes. Moreover, Grace For Drowning cements Wilson's position at the forefront of audio engineering, as it is the first-ever rock album released primarily in Blu-ray video format. The standard edition of the album comes in 5.1 surround sound with accompanying video content for each song, including music videos by Lasse Hoile and interactive features that bring fans right into the studio with Wilson during the recording process. It will also be available as a deluxe edition that comes packaged with 3 CDs and a 120-page book of artwork and notes, a 180-gram vinyl edition, and a standard CD edition.";

But I’m not retiring!!” The first leg of this headline tour, in some of the UK’s most beautiful theatres, will encompass Warwick’s monumental career, with songs from her hugely successful recording catalogue including a selection of classic Warwick/Burt Bacharach/Hal David songs such as ‘I Say A Little Prayer’, ‘Do You Know The Way To San Jose’, ‘Anyone Who Had A Heart’ and ‘Walk On By’. Warwick ranks among the 40 biggest hit makers of the entire rock era (1955-1999), based on the Billboard Hot 100 Pop Singles Charts. She is one of the most-charted female vocalists of all time, with 56 of her singles making the Billboard Hot 100 between 1962 and 1998, and 80 singles making all Billboard charts combined.;

Their numerous hits were R&B based with an undercurrent of jazz - a very unusual but winning combination of playing style and substance. As a result, their records have a timeless quality and, some 55 years on, The Manfreds, with original front man, Paul Jones, will be performing many of their hits, including ‘Do Wah Diddy Diddy’, one of the most popular and instantly recognisable songs of the ‘60’s,and still the biggest audience pleaser at their concerts, along with a mix of Jazz and Blues covers and tracks from their individual solo albums. Paul Jones, with his unique harmonica sound, will be joined by Mike Hugg on keyboards, Tom McGuinness on guitar, Rob Townsend on drums, Marcus Cliffe on bass, and Simon Currie on saxophone/ flute.;

Imagine marrying the 21st century party vibe of Miley Cyrus or the minimalist angst of Radiohead with the crackly warmth of a vintage 78 or the plunger-muted barrelhouse howl of a forgotten Kansas City jazzman. Bradlee's choice of material ranges from the '80s hard rock of Guns N' Roses to hits as recent as Taylor Swift's controversial ""Look What You Made Me Do."" They're rendered by a rotating cast of musicians and singers in fashions that date back to a time when Axl, Slash and T-Swift's parents had yet to be born - a time of street corner harmonies and torch singers, blues belters and golden-voiced crooners.";

At the start of 1981, Ultravox were laying their claim to be one of the defining acts of the 80s following the global success of hit 'Vienna'. Heading back into the studio the same year invigorated, they recorded their second album with Ure as frontman, Rage in Eden, which hit the Top 5 in the UK album charts. Quartet, their third album with Ure, came in quick succession in 1982 with production from legendary Beatles producer George Martin. Continuing the band's impressive chart run, it became their third Top 10 album, featuring four Top 20 singles including the anthem 'Hymn'. Transporting fans back to the decade of electronics, experimentation, synthesizers and great songwriting, the albums highlights will be showcased alongside landmark hits from Ure's incredible back catalogue. Midge Ure said of the tour: 'I can't begin to tell you how great it feels to be back out touring after the uncertainty of the past two years and it is especially exciting to delve back in time and revitalise two standout albums from my career, Rage in Eden and Quartet. This is the logical and emotional follow up to the 1980 tour';

The all-new tour Queen Machine Symphonic featuring Kerry Ellis will see Queen’s greatest hits performed by leading European tribute band Queen Machine accompanied by the London Symphonic Rock Orchestra and conducted by Matthew Freeman, creating an unforgettable night of rock anthems. The 2020 tour, which promises to really rock you, comes to Glasgow’s Royal Concert Hall on Thursday, April 16 2020. Making their UK touring debut, Queen Machine are the go-to tribute band for the Official International Queen Fan Club and are one of the most popular bands in their native Denmark and neighbouring Scandinavian countries where they repeatedly sell out shows. Joining them will be the UK’s leading lady of musical theatre Kerry Ellis, who originated the role of Meat, in Queen musical We Will Rock You. Since then, she’s forged a long-standing musical relationship and friendship with Queen guitarist Brian May, who describes the stage star as having “Britain’s most beautiful voice”. He produced her debut album Anthems, and they jointly released the follow up Golden Days in 2017, as well as extensively touring the UK and Europe together. Conducting the tour will be Matthew Freeman, a platinum and gold disc award-winning conductor and arranger. He originally reworked the music of Queen for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in 2011 and conducted their Symphonic Queen concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 2011 and 2014. The Symphonic Queen album was released in 2016. Bjarke Baisner fronts Queen Machine, sounding and looking like a young Freddie Mercury, joined by Peter Møller Jeppesen on guitar, Henrik Østergaard on keys, Jens Lunde on bass and Paolo Romano Torquati on drums. The Official International Queen Fan Club hails Queen Machine as: “Quite simply one of THE best Queen tribute bands we have ever had at any of our events – don’t miss them.” Ben Hatton, Director of Theatre Touring for promoters Cuffe and Taylor, said: “For fans of the incredible music of Queen this promises to be a must-see show. Brian May describes Kerry Ellis’s voice as ‘perfect’, and she’s long been associated with her versions of Queen tracks. “Bringing together the London Symphonic Rock Orchestra with the powerhouse performances of Kerry and Queen Machine, to perform those iconic hits – We Will Rock You, Killer Queen, Somebody To Love, Barcelona and, of course, Bohemian Rhapsody – promises to create a truly sensational celebration of one of the most iconic bands in musical history.” Since forming in 2018, the London Symphonic Rock Orchestra have recorded for Sir Cliff Richard’s Rise Up album and performed live with the Trevor Horn Band on Trevor Horn Reimagines The 80s at the Southbank Centre.;

Epic fantasy music which brings to life the worlds of Middle Earth and the Seven Kingdoms.;"They are the most beloved and recognisable big and small screen creations of all time – let alone just in the world of the Fantasy genre –and now the music of Game of Thrones, The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit will be celebrated in a special orchestral concert at Birmingham Symphony Hall, following on from triumphant previous shows at the London Palladium. The show, presented by Senbla and Silva Screen Live, will be a celebration of the music from the most memorable moments from across the world’s of Middle Earth and the Seven Kingdoms, which Sci-Fi Bulletin called in 2017 “ a three-in-one précis of some great music”. The stunning musical accompaniments will be performed live by a huge orchestra, creating an immersive live concert experience that is every bit as thrilling as the twists and turns in the world’s respective histories. Game of Thrones is a TV show like no other – the hit HBO series has captured the hearts and minds of millions the world over, and its recent finale was perhaps the most talked about in television in history. Composer Ramin Djawadi began creating the music for the show in 2011, with most of the eerie, magnificent score back then being penned for a small string ensemble. With the success of the next six seasons of the show, the music budget became bigger and bigger, allowing Djawadi to create even more emphatic pieces for large orchestras. The success of HBO’s Game of Thrones is almost unfathomable. The small screen adaptation of George R.R Martin’s series of fantasy novels has drawn in record numbers of viewers all across the world, being awarded thirty-eight Emmy Awards so far. One of the most successful film series of all time, The Lord of The Rings, as well as it’s prequel series The Hobbit, will also have their most memorable pieces performed live in the concert. The original trilogy of The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King, directed by Peter Jackson, are among the highest grossing film series of all time, as well as being critically acclaimed – winning a combined 17 out of the 30 Academy Awards they were nominated for. Composed by Howard Shore, conceived the soundtrack as music of unparalleled power and invention, demanding of huge resources - a large symphonic ensemble, and scored around 95% of the films’ length – eventually having over 12 hours of music released over various formats / used in the films. The success of the The Lord of the Rings’ soundtrack led Shore to also score Peter Jackson’s follow-up prequels to Lord of the Rings; The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, The Desolation of Smaug, and The Battle of the Five Armies. Now audiences in Birmingham can experience a concert celebrating one of the most vital and stand-out aspects of the Fantasy genre in an all-encompassing live concert experience at the Symphony Hall – though fans will have to be quick to snap up the precious tickets!";

The virtuoso blending of operatic technique with romantic and popular song took the world by storm, with sales of over 22 million. Their first three albums, Il Divo, Ancora and Siempre scored 36 number 1 chart positions across 26 countries. But success was hard earned. The trick of Il Divo has been to make it look so easy. The public fell for these four handsome men, singing their hearts out, transforming some of the great songs of the popular canon with outstanding vocal skills.

The standard is mind-blowingly high, it has really been a thrill to discover them.' - Roger Taylor, Queen. Launching summer 2012, The Queen Extravaganza is a spectacular touring concert show designed to take the glorious music and the live experience of legends of rock, Queen, to generations of fans. Behind the show is Queen's iconic drummer Roger Taylor, a man whose own talents as a writer and musician have inspired such legends of modern times as The Foo Fighters, The Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Katie Perry, and even Lady Gaga, who took her name from one of his biggest hit songs. Taylor's idea was to the create the ultimate Queen concert experience in an electrifying road show that celebrates the bands music and legacy performed by some of the best new music talent working today. Taylor personally takes the role of producer and music director. To guarantee the touring show matches the fabled design and excitement of Queen at its live best, Taylor has enlisted a heavyweight production team headed by stage designer Mark Fisher. Fisher has been responsible for some of the most memorable rock concerts ever staged, including The Wall‚ for Pink Floyd, every Rolling Stones show since 1989, and, working with lighting designer Willie Williams, every U2 concert. Taylors Queen Extravaganza touring band - four vocalists (Yvan Pedneault, Marc Martel, Jennifer Espinoza, Jeff Scott Soto) and five musicians (guitar-Brian Gresh & Tristan Avakian, bass-Francois Olivier Doyon, drums-Tyler Warren and keyboards-Brandon Ethridge) - were hired after an intensive six week online audition search. The buzz surrounding the public auditions sparked worldwide interest with video submissions generating more than 6.4 million views. Television host Ellen DeGeneres was so impressed with the level of talent, that she invited one hopeful to perform his audition on her show. That contestant, Nashville's Marc Martel, secured himself a place in the final band. In a show which will run just over two hours of playing time, with a 30 minute break, The QE band will perform close on 40 true Queen classics drawn from a list of the bands biggest all-time chart hits: 'Bohemian Rhapsody', 'Another One Bites the Dust', 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love', 'Under Pressure', 'We Will Rock You/We Are the Champions', 'A Kind of Magic', 'Radio Ga Ga', 'Somebody to Love'‚ 'Killer Queen', as well as highlighting some of the bands finest heavy-duty rock based anthems which have long been at the core of their live performances, so audiences can also expect a healthy dose of early period Queen‚ with songs such as 'I'm In Love With My Car', 'Tie Your Mother Down', 'Seven Seas of Rye', 'In the Lap Of The Gods', among them. Production values will be boosted with the inclusion of never-before-seen video footage. Taylor sums up: 'The Queen Extravaganza will not be like a traditional tribute show. It is a brand new show specially designed to enable these new fans, together with fans of old, to celebrate the music of Queen in a heart stopping event.' 'Its going to be very spectacular, its going to be very visual, there are going to be some shocks and some tremendous surprises. It will be a rock celebration in the Royal tradition.' 'I think you can expect not to be bored for one second.';

The Portland, Oregon-formed group will perform live at London’s Royal Albert Hall before travelling to Edinburgh and Liverpool before culminating in Birmingham. For a quarter of a century, Pink Martini have fused a unique blend of jazz, world music, cabaret, lounge and 1940-50s film music, with the New York Times describing them as the ‘suave salon orchestra’. Ever since their formation, they have wowed crowds worldwide with their signature cocktail of crowd-pleasing classical, pop and jazz arrangements by fouder, bandleader and pianist Thomas Lauderdale, showcased by the lux vocals of long term collaborator China Forbes, alongside the eclectic instrumentals of their one of a kind musical ensemble, and have performed in 22 different languages. Their most recent album, ‘Hotel Amour’, was released earlier in 2019 in collaboration with the international singing sensation Meow Meow, also featuring guest appearances by Rufus Wainwright, The von Trapps, Barry Humphries (of Dame Edna fame), and the inimitable late French pianist and composer, Michel Legrand.;

The same year Arthur paid tribute to his late father by performing PCO’s seminal record Union Cafe live to a sold out Union Chapel, coinciding with the album’s re-issue on Erased Tapes. 2018 saw the Penguins perform in Paris, Berlin and London with a special show to support Greenpeace at the new venue EartH in Hackney. Arthur and his group are back in the studio creating their forthcoming fifth studio album, due for release in autumn 2019.;

Few of the original members survive (with The Temptations alone having had at least 20 different members pass through their ranks over the years), but the songs -- from 'Get Ready' to 'Reach Out I'll Be There' -- most certainly do.;Motown legends The Four Tops and The Temptations announce a UK arena tour this year, stopping at The O2 on Tuesday 27 November 2018. They will be joined by special guests, yet to be announced. These two bands are true icons and epitomise the Motown sound that shook the world in the 60s and continues to delight audiences, old and new. The Four Tops have a vast catalogue of hits, with 27 UK top 40 singles, which include I Can’t Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch) and the 1966 number one Reach Out (I’ll Be There). The line-up for the tour includes original member Duke Fakir plus Ronnie McNeir, Lawrence Payton and Harold ‘Spike’ Bonhart.

646912;/events/images/646912.jpg;Bon Iver;2021-10-27T18:00:00+01:00;;Music;Standard;30.03;52.03;GBP;17642;Manchester;50554;AO Arena;Trinity Way Hunts Bank;M3 1AR;Manchester;Justin Vernon returns with more delicate and beautiful acoustic folk and Americana.;Ever since the door swung shut on that north woods cabin, we all felt like Justin entered a future we had imagined as kids. It was an obsessive, simple dream we shared as teenagers growing up in Wisconsin: just music, always. For me that started with Justin asking: “Trev, wanna be in a band?” as we passed each other in the hallway in front of our high school’s trophy case. From then on, along with five of our closest friends, we played anything together, giving everything a go. From jazz standards and ska vamps, free improv freak-outs and marching band anthems to writing our own music. Through these musical experiences, we began to find and form our hearts collectively. All together we assembled musical materials that reflected and produced a shared consciousness that continues today: how we respond to certain tonalities, how to create atmospheres and what we want them to do, which harmonies bring forth places we seek out, how particular articulations can explain more than words can even begin to attempt. Motion and thoughts aligned. Collective goals formed piece by piece. This was how the dream began.But dreams adjust in new realities. Bands came and went. Time passed in Wisconsin, people moved apart and pursued inner impulses that had been set-asideduring our youth. Maybe we should have trusted ourselves more, but all we knew was music and being together, so we rightfully questioned how we could stand as individuals. Many of us moved to North Carolina, I was on the other side of the ocean. For a fewyears I only heard small vignettes of my friends’ new life down south. And then my heart split when I heard that Justin was leaving North Carolina to return to Wisconsin. I watched from afar as my friends began to tear apart. What could have happened? I felt helpless. And then For Emma, Forever Agoemerged. When I read the album title, my heart sank again. My reaction was more worry than anything. I knew Justin’s recourse to isolation and the past, almost a crippling nostalgia that prevented him from moving onward. This title was a beacon looking back. Butwhen I finally heard the music, I felt relief –itwas Justin, raw and vulnerable, as the music had always been. In fact, it was almost normal in how extraordinary it was.Something had shifted with this set of music, something had been lit. For Emma, Forever Agobroke open that fantastic dream into a reality. And before the harness could be thrown over that realized dream, Bon Iver, Bon Iver cemented its animation.Throughout these last years I have met many people in different parts of the world who have been enchanted by Bon Iver. No doubt it has been thrilling to witness but it has also been odd at times. Perhaps it is the widespread exposure of our lives, this communityof friends. Hearing someone sing along to “I’m with Hagen”, a sign of our personal alliance, or “3rd & Lake, it burnt away”, a disappeared place of countless hangs, makes one curious about how a thing can be shared. In my most cynical thoughts, I wonder: How can this be relevant to someone else?However Justin has managed to connect such intimate, banal, and forgotten moments to many people. These moments are now shared widely and no longer belong only to us. But who owns a memory?When your voice is responded to in the world’s cosmic conversation, when your words and sounds travel to the depths of strangers’ souls, life’s dream can carry you forward at a pace you had never travelled at before. The collective excitement pushes your foot to the gas because isn’t this the only thing to do? Isn’t this exactly what we had imagined or hoped? It became too much to handle for Justin. Something was left behind in such a mad dash over the course of these recent years. The music stopped giving back. The acceleration, repetition and exposure transformed that coveted dream into what felt like a mind-numbing theme park. What is this for? What are we even trying to accomplish here? The teenage fantasy, that shared memory of the future, was now in disguise. A shapeless figure, present but unrecognizable.This spectacular upheaval of life after these albums provoked an inner storm, a mental sickness of anxiety for Justin. Of course it did. The dream had taken on its own life. It all came to a head on an emptyAtlantic beach. I bore witness to my best friend crying in my arms, lost in a world of confusion and removal. Justin could barely even talk. It was only days before, on a misguided solo trip to an island off the coast of Greece, that he had recorded the opening words of 22, A Million, “It might be over soon”, into a portable sampler. The forecast that begins this next Bon Iver undertaking is a reminder of our fragile existence. How when everything appears stable, it may crumble and fall through our fingers. How do we hold on to what is important? How do we make sense of the events that rip us apart? What choices do we have and how do we make them? It was the beginning of an unwinding of an immense knot inside. When confronted with daemons one must hold up the mirror in order to see the other side. For Justin, that begins with 22.22 stands for Justin. The number’s recurrence in his life has become a meaningful pattern through encounter and recognition. A mile marker, a jersey number, a bill total. The reflection of ‘2’ is his identity bound up in duality: the relationship he has with himself and the relationship he has with the rest of the world. A Millionis the rest of that world: the millions of people who we will never know, the infinite and endless, everything outside one’s self that makes you who you are. This other side of Justin’s duality is the thing that completes him and what he searches for. 22, A Millionis thus part love letter, part final resting place of two decades of searching for self-understanding like a religion. And theinner-resolution of maybe never finding that understanding. When Justin sings,“I’m still standing in the need of prayer” he begs the question of what’s worth worshipping, or rather, what is possible to worship. Ifmusic is a sacred form of discovering, knowing and being, then Bon Iver’s albums are totems to that faith.Yet when it came time to make a new album, the music was all exhausted. After Bon Iver, Bon Iver, it felt asif thewell had gone dry. Confronting himself also meant facing this loss of direction sense in his music. Through different groups of friends—close, passing, new, old—he began to assemble proto-melodies, vague textures and specific moods from hundreds of hours of recorded improvisations. Thesewere the skeleton keys to unlock not just how 22, A Million could sound, but how it was felt, what it was for, what is was about: the power of human connectivity through music. The poly-fi record formed at the congruence of a bold yet delicate sonic palette. These sounds were the way out from the suffocating enclosure and captivity of anxiety.The ten songs of 22, A Millionare a collection of sacred moments, love’s torment and salvation, contexts of intense memories, signs that you can pin meaning onto or disregard as coincidence. If Bon Iver, Bon Iverbuilt a habitat rooted in physical spaces, then 22, A Millionis the letting go of that attachment to a place. “I’m taking deeper consideration in another kind of place–our friendships and connections to other people.” Justin proclaims this shift in ’33 “GOD”’: “These will just be places to me now”. Rather than placeswe encounter a collection of numerical relationships: binary code, mystic ages, Bible chapters, math-logic, repeating infinities. Inside these numbers are a sonic distillation of imagery fromthe past years of turbulence and how to recover. We hear about positionality (“Down along the creek”, “In the stair up off the hot car lot”), strategies (“I’d make myself escape”, “Steal androb it”), situations (“Carrying his guitar”, “Sent your sister home in a cab”), new lexicon (“Astuary King”, “Wandry”, “Paramind”) temporalities (“The math ahead, the math behind”, “It might be over soon”) and repeated visuals (“Five lane divers”). These words reveal the riddle of dualities: pain and love, suffering and redemption, omens and happenstance. Such ambiguity and interpretation is the core of how Justin composes words: there are always two ways to see something. Beneath this Daoist-impressionism, we hear the footsteps of a process, the relationships that havekneaded the album’s cause. A locked horns angel, empathetic ears and sagely blessings—friends who have provided themselves in different roles to mold this music into form.To narrow this album down to the next step within an “artistic career” would be tomiss a far grander purpose of this music—or any music for that matter—and the cultures of friendship that sustain us in our capacities to even play music. Although 22, A Millionemerges from a swirling context of transformation in Justin’s recent life, itis based on how we have always approached what music can be or do. It is not the perceived power of money and fame that will change the course of events in one’s life, but empathy. Music is a pathway that allows us to listen to ourselves and the people that surround us. It is a pathway to understanding that actively creates change in real-time. Music, even in its most intimate moments, isa pathway between us all. It is the nuts and bolts of humanity as well as its totality. It is made sacred between people and in return makes those relationships sacred. It is the buoyant substance that we grab onto when the water rises above our heads. The answer has been here the entire time: just music, always.;0844 847 8000

None of the members had any formal musical training, not even the ability to play any instruments. They were popular during the late 1970s and early 1980s, a period when lots of similar ska bands filled the charts. Some of their hits include 'My Girl Lollipop', 'Lip Up Fatty', 'Special Brew' and 'Ne-Ne-Na-Na-Na-Na-Nu-Nu'. One of the main reasons for their notoriety was because of their outlandish, larger-than-life, huge tongued & shaven-headed front man. Buster´s exploits got them banned from the British TV chart show Top of the Pops (which included dressing as Henry VIII and singing to a blow-up doll for the song 'Lorraine', pouring a large can of baked beans over his head, and dressing in a can-can dancer´s dress to promote their single 'Can-Can').;0115 896 4456

The album found them nominated for numerous industry accolades: MTV Music Video Awards (for which they won their first Moonman, for ""Buttons""), American Music Awards, Billboard Awards, Soul Train Awards - and ""Stickwitu"" earned them the sweetest nomination of them all, a Grammy nod for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

On performing at Live at Chelsea, Mick said: “I’m thrilled that we’ve got the chance to play in such beautiful surroundings, but the real privilege for us is in supporting the veterans of this country, who have given so much. We can’t wait!” As the only concert series staged at this beautiful venue, Live at Chelsea is hosted in a fully seated auditorium in the Royal Hospital Chelsea’s central courtyard – the Hospital itself was founded by King Charles II in 1682 and is home to the Chelsea Pensioners, 300 retired soldiers. A portion of the ticket sale proceeds will also go towards funding care for the Chelsea Pensioners (retired soldiers) who live at the Royal Hospital, as well as helping to fund the ongoing maintenance of the Grade I listed site.;

The Killers are Brandon Flowers (vocals/keyboards), Dave Keuning (guitars), Mark Stoermer (bass) and Ronnie Vannucci (drums).;The Killers are a Las Vegas-based four-piece who formed in 2003, featuring the talents of singer/keyboardist Brandon Flowers, drummer Ronnie Vanucci, guitarist Dave Keuning and bassist Mark Stoermer. The band has received countless accolades for their artistic achievement, including multiple Grammy nominations, American Music Award nominations, MTV Video Music Awards, NME Awards and more. Their first album, Hot Fuss, was released in 2004 to worldwide acclaim. The album contained the singles “Mr. Brightside” and “Somebody Told Me,” in addition to the anthemic song “All These Things That I’ve Done,” which has since been referenced by the likes of U2 and Coldplay. The band toured for two years straight behind Hot Fuss, playing more than four-hundred shows, and eventually returned to Vegas to begin to work on the follow-up album with legendary producers Alan Moulder and Flood. The result, a love letter of sorts to their hometown entitled Sam’s Town, was released in 2006 and spent forty-two weeks on the Billboard Top 200. A b-sides collection entitled Sawdust was released in 2007, followed by their third studio album, Day & Age, which was released to widespread critical praise in 2008, anchored by massive single “Human.” The Killers released Battle Born in September 2012, which saw them expanding their world tour into countries they’ve never visited before, and finally were honored to perform at the world-renowned Wembley Arena, one of the most monumental and significant shows of their career. After a decade of making music, in November 2013, The Killers released a “Best Of” collection, Direct Hits, which featured two incredible new songs alongside classics from the band’s revered catalogue. The band, who have sold over twenty-five million albums worldwide, and headlined all of the world’s top festivals (Coachella, Lollapalooza, Glastonbury), will release their newest studio album, Wonderful Wonderful, in September 2017.;

They have won two Brit Awards and earlier this month, they took home their fifth MOBO Award, matching Kanye West’s current record and firmly placing them as one of the UKs most successful music groups. Oritsé, Marvin, Aston and JB have recently shifted gear into a fresh era with the release of new album, Evolution. The album deftly documents a growth for the boys and sees them move in a more urban direction. Evolution also saw JLS working with a stellar list of American urban producers, including hip hop producers The Runners [Rihanna, Chris Brown, Rick Ross] and the legendary R&B hit-maker Rodney Jerkins [TLC, Kanye West, Beyoncé].;

108326;/events/images/108326.jpg;The Damned;2021-07-18T19:00:00+01:00;;Music;Standard;0.0;65.0;GBP;17642;Manchester;50553;O2 Apollo Manchester;Stockport Road Ardwick Green;M12 6AP;Manchester;The punk legends, fronted by Dave Vanian, zip through their pithy catalogue.The line-up has changed over but front man Vanian has remained throughout.;"With punk's history having entered a new millennium, the impact of the band initially judged ""the least likely to"" seems to grow ever more each day. The Ramones hold deserved pride of place for kick-starting the whole thing, while the Sex Pistols -- and to a lesser extent, the Clash -- helped take it to an even more notorious level, serving as role models for many young bands to this day. But arguably just as important and memorable were the Damned, London contemporaries of the Pistols and Clash that made their own mark from the start. Eschewing political posing, ill-fitting outside rhetoric and simply doing the same thing over and over again, the group -- which lacked anything like a stable lineup -- took punk's simplicity and promise as a starting point and ran with it. The end result, at the group's finest: a series of inspired, ambitious albums and amazing live shows combining full-on rock energy, a stylish sense of performance, and humorous deadpan cool. Not necessarily what anyone would have thought when Ray Burns and Chris Millar met in 1974, when both ended up working backstage at the Croydon Fairfield Hall. Burns and Millar -- more famously known in later years as guitarist/singer Captain Sensible and manic drummer Rat Scabies -- kept in touch as both struggled in the stultifying mid-'70s London scene. Things picked up when Scabies talked his way into a rehearsal with London S.S., the shifting lineup ground zero of U.K. punk that nearly everybody seemed to belong to at one point or another. There he met guitarist Brian James, while in a separate venture overseen by Malcolm McLaren, casting about for his own particular group to oversee, Scabies first met theatrical singer Dave Vanian, still working through his New York Dolls/Alice Cooper obsession. Vanian's own history allegedly included singing ""I Love the Dead"" and ""Dead Babies"" while working as a gravedigger, but whatever the background, he proved to be a perfect frontman. Scabies put Sensible in touch with Vanian and James and the Damned were born, with Sensible switching over to bass while James handled guitar and songwriting. Though the Sex Pistols became the most publicized of all the original London punk groups, forming and playing before everyone else, the Damned actually ended up scoring most of the firsts on its own, notably the first U.K. punk single -- ""New Rose"" -- in 1976 and the first album, Damned Damned Damned, the following year. Produced by Nick Lowe, both were clipped, direct explosions of sheer energy, sometimes rude but never less than entertaining. The group ended up sacked from the Pistols' cancellation-plagued full U.K. tour after only one show, but rebounded with an opening slot on the final T. Rex tour, while further tweaking everyone else's noses by being the first U.K. act to take punk back to America via a New York jaunt. Things started to get fairly shaky after that, however, with Lu Edmonds drafted in on second guitar and plans for the group's second album, Music for Pleasure, not succeeding as hoped for. The members wanted legendary rock burnout Syd Barrett to produce, but had to settle for his Pink Floyd bandmate Nick Mason. The indifferent results and other pressures convinced Scabies to call it a day, and while future Culture Club drummer Jon Moss was drafted in to cover, the group wrapped it up in early 1978. Or so it seemed; after various go-nowhere ventures (Sensible tried the retro-psych King, Vanian temporarily joined glam-too-late oddballs the Doctors of Madness), all the original members save James realized they still enjoyed working together. Settling the legal rights to the name after some shows incognito in late 1978, the group, now with Sensible playing lead guitar (and also the first U.K. punk band to reunite), embarked on its most successful all-around period. With a series of bassists -- first ex-Saints member Algy Ward, then Eddie and the Hot Rods refugee Paul Gray and finally Bryn Merrick -- the Damned proceeded to make a run of stone-cold classic albums and singles. There'd be plenty of low points amidst the highs, to be sure, but it's hard to argue with the results. Vanian's smart crooning and spooky theatricality ended up more or less founding goth rock inadvertently (with nearly all his clones forgetting what he always kept around -- an open sense of humor). Sensible, meanwhile, turned out to be an even better guitarist than James, a master of tight riffs and instantly memorable melodies and, when needed, a darn good keyboardist, while Scabies' ghost-of-Keith Moon drumming was some of the most entertaining yet technically sharp work on that front in years.The one-two punch of Machine Gun Etiquette, the 1979 reunion record, and the following year's The Black Album demonstrated the band's staying power well, packed with such legendary singles as the intentionally ridiculous ""Love Song,"" the anthemic ""Smash It Up,"" and ""Wait for the Blackout"" and the catchy Satanism (if you will) of ""I Just Can't Be Happy Today."" On the live front, the Damned were unstoppable, riding out punk's supposed death with a series of fiery performances laden with both great playing and notable antics, from Sensible's penchant for clothes-shedding to Vanian's eye for horror style and performance. Released in 1982, Strawberries found the Damned creating another generally fine release, but to less public acclaim than Sensible's solo work, the guitarist having surprisingly found himself a number one star with a version of ""Happy Talk"" from South Pacific. While the dual career lasted for a year or two more, the Damned found themselves starting to fracture again with little more than a hardcore fan base supporting the group work -- Sensible finally left in mid-1984 after disputes over band support staff hirings and firings. Second guitarist Roman Jugg, having joined some time previously, stepped to the lead and the band continued on. To everyone's surprise, not only did the Damned bounce back, they did so in a very public way -- first by ending up on a major label, MCA, who issued Phantasmagoria in 1985, then scoring a massive U.K. hit via a cover of ""Eloise,"" a melodramatic '60s smash for Barry Ryan. It was vindication on a commercial level a decade after having first started, but the Anything album in 1986, flashes of inspiration aside, felt far more anonymous in comparison, the band's worst since Music for Pleasure. After a full career retrospective release, The Light at the End of the Tunnel, the band undertook a variety of farewell tours, including dates with both Sensible and James joining the then-current quartet. The end of 1989 brought a final We Really Must Be Going tour in the U.K., featuring the original quartet in one last bow, which would seem to have been the end to things. Anything but. The I Didn't Say It tour arrived in 1991, with Paul Gray rejoining the band to play along with the quartet. It was the first in a series of dates and shows throughout the '90s which essentially confirmed the group as a nostalgia act, concentrating on the early part of its career for audiences often too young to have even heard about them the first time around. It was a good nostalgia act, though, with performances regularly showing the old fire (and Sensible his legendary stage presence, often finishing shows nude). After some 1992 shows, the Damned disappeared again for a while -- but when December 1993 brought some more dates, an almost all-new band was the result. Only Scabies and Vanian remained, much like the late '80s lineup; their cohorts were guitarists Kris Dollimore and Alan Lee Shaw and bassist Moose. This quintet toured and performed in Japan and Europe for about two years, also recording demos here and there that Vanian claimed he believed were for a projected future album with both Sensible and James contributing. Whatever the story, nothing more might have happened if Scabies hadn't decided to work out a formal release of those demos as Not of This Earth, first appearing in Japan in late November 1995. Vanian, having reestablished contact with Sensible during the former's touring work with his Phantom Chords band, responded by breaking with Scabies, reuniting fully with Sensible and recruiting a new group to take over the identity of the Damned. Initially this consisted of Gray once again, plus drummer Garrie Dreadful and keyboardist Monty. However, Gray was replaced later in 1996 following an on-stage tantrum by, in a totally new twist, punk veteran Patricia Morrison, known for her work in the Gun Club and the Sisters of Mercy among many other bands. Scabies reacted to all this with threats of lawsuits and vituperative public comments, but after all was said and done, Vanian, Sensible, and company maintained the rights to the name, occasional billing as ""ex-members of the Damned"" aside, done to avoid further trouble. Since then, this latest version of the Damned has toured on a fairly regular basis, though this time with instability in the drumming department (Dreadful left at the end of 1998, first replaced by Spike, then later in 1999 by Pinch). While Vanian continued to pursue work with the Phantom Chords, for the first time in years, the Damned started to become a true outfit once again, the lineup gelling and holding together enough to warrant further attention. The capper was a record contract in 2000 with Nitro Records, the label founded and run by longtime Damned fanatic Dexter Holland, singer with the Offspring (who covered ""Smash It Up"" for the Batman Forever soundtrack in the mid-'90s). In a fun personal note, meanwhile, Morrison and Vanian married, perhaps making them the ultimate punk/goth couple of all time. By 2001, the Vanian/Sensible-led Damned looked to be in fine shape, releasing the album Grave Disorder on Nitro and touring to general acclaim. Knowing the fractured history of the band -- captured in the literally endless series of releases, authorized and otherwise, from all periods of its career, live, studio, compilations, and more -- only a foolish person would claim things would stay on an even keel for the future. Permanently losing Scabies would seem to have been a killer blow on first blush, but the group has soldiered on regardless, a welcome influence from the past as well as a group of fine entertainers for the present. The year 2005 found both eras of the band being represented. While the new lineup was touring and working on a new album, the original lineup was honored by the three-disc box set Play It at Your Sister, which was released on the Sanctuary label. The limited-edition set covered the years 1976-1977, featuring all the tracks from the first two albums along with John Peel sessions and live material. It soon came time for the new lineup to issue its own album, which arrived in 2008 in the form of a slick, pop-influenced record titled So, Who's Paranoid?";

Frontman Ryan Tedder is also the individual to hold responsible for Leona Lewis's 'Bleeding Love'.;"""You're only as good as your worst song,"" says OneRepublic's front man and chief songwriter Ryan Tedder. Not that he knows anything about writing a dud. The 30-year-old born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has obsessed over the art of pop music for more than a decade. Along the way, he's worked with Rihanna, Beyonc, Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Jennifer Lopez, Leona Lewis (he shared a 2008 Best Record Grammy nod for her ""Bleeding Love""), and other massive stars. And it's all lead him back to his own Denver, Colorado-based band, where he pours out his most heartfelt music. ""The writing approach I take for OneRepublic is completely different from the approach I take with anyone else -- it's infinitely harder,"" Tedder says. ""These songs have to be personalized. And I write each of them like it's the last one I'll be able to put out."" It works. OneRepublic was nominated for a Grammy in 2008 for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. And Tedder, plus guitarists Zach Filkins and Drew Brown, bassist/cellist Brent Kutzle and drummer Eddie Fisher have sold almost 2 million albums and 8 million singles. The band's 2007 hit ""Apologize,"" from their album Dreaming Out Loud went to No. 1 in 16 countries, going gold in 14 of them. It broke records for airplay when it finally made it to radio (and was only bested by Lewis's ""Bleeding Love,"" which Tedder co-wrote). Their second single, ""Stop and Stare,"" propelled OneRepublic beyond platinum status. Waking Up is their second album on Mosley/Interscope Records. Their latest single ""All the Right Moves"" comes with a huge heap of anticipation from the millions of fans of OneRepublic and Tedder. But there are countless others who may not know the band or its members' names but recognize their heartfelt songs from the soundtrack of their last bad breakup or emotional meltdown. OneRepublic is that band. While breaking sales, the members OneRepublic have proved for years that hard work pays off. As sensational as their rocket trip up the charts may have seemed, nothing happened for them overnight. Filkins learned guitar at age 7 while living with his parents in Barcelona, Spain. ""I wanted to play loud and crazy,"" he says. But his parents made him learn Flamenco. Tedder discovered vocal harmonies via the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds (on cassette). He sang secretly at first -- to himself in his room or with his Walkman on. And some of the most satisfying pop tunes he heard as a kid were those on the soundtracks of the '80s movies he watched over and over. A fascination directly related to OneRepublic's epic and cinematic sound. Tedder and Filkins met in their senior year in high school in Colorado Springs. They formed a band called This Beautiful Mess and played one talent show but broke up after a week. Far from the young angst-ridden punks that threw together set lists with three chords and the truth -- ""We were not the Ramones,"" Filkins jokes -- the would-be OneRepublic founders vowed to spend their time and energy sharpening their skills as musicians and songwriters before they made another leap into band life. ""Most bands they play for years and they suck,"" Tedder says. ""They figure out writing on the back end if they figure it out at all. I always wanted to know that as long as I was alive, I could write the kind of songs that would be hits so I would have a career."" Between his junior and senior years at college Tedder won an MTV songwriting contest and got a record deal but walked away from an opportunity to write bubblegum pop at the height of the boy band craze -- he wanted something deeper and felt he had more to learn. So at age 19, he moved to Nashville, where he landed his first regular paying gig recording demos. Secretly, he was figuring out not how the biggest country artists hit notes but how they wrote hits. ""I had the advantage of seeing all these artists coming through and seeing the ones that worked and the ones that didn't,"" Tedder says. ""I learned that people who write great songs are the ones that have careers."" At about that time, Timbaland, who'd seen Tedder on MTV, reached out to the promising young songwriter, offering him a production deal and a chance to work together in Miami. Filkins, meanwhile, had studied aerospace engineering at college in Illinois but saw his grades slip as his passion for guitar playing blossomed. By 2003, he had moved to Colorado to study music and engineering. Tedder moved back to Colorado, too, after studying what he calls ""Producer 101"" with Timbaland in Miami. Having done all they could to minimize the risk of starting a band and gone about the typically impetuous process in the most studied, measured, and completely backward way possible, the two moved to L.A. to start OneRepublic. After some early lineup changes, the Oregon- and California-raised Fisher followed a dream he'd hatched after seeing a U2 concert at Tempe Stadium in Arizona, the very concert recorded for Rattle and Hum. His former band mate Drew Brown, born and raised in Boulder, Colorado, had seen his first show as a 10-year-old in 1994 -- Weezer, with Teenage Fanclub. His dad threw him in the mosh pit to give him the full experience. Brown returned the favor years later by calling and asking his parents for money so he could move to L.A. to join OneRepublic. ""Only recently my dad stopped regretting taking me to that concert,"" he says. Songwriting alone landed them in a short-lived deal with Columbia. But what followed was a grind of mostly small L.A. club shows that didn't always work for the groups huge sound. They parted ways with the label, and while driving home from a show one night, Filkins, then 27 and working as a filing clerk for Coca-Cola, told Tedder, who was making money writing music for movies on the side, that he was quitting the band if nothing major happened for them in six months. Six months later, almost to the day, Timbaland's remix of ""Apologize"" broke on the radio. The original version had racked up millions of plays on MySpace, and Tedder says its familiarity was key in driving the Timbaland remix up the charts. When the super-producer started his own Mosley Music Group with Interscope, he signed OneRepublic as his first band. Fast forward through massive hits and record-breaking sales to 2009, and the band is training its laser-like focus on performing, completing their upside down approach to rock stardom. On the road for the last year and half, whether playing sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York, the massive New Pop festival in Germany or the V Fest in the U.K., the band's live show has gelled, the members say. Waking Up, recorded in their hometown Denver, is the band's most sweeping, cinematic effort to date, with even more strings and movie-like moments, thanks in part to the use of the same children's choir and orchestra used by Batman and Edward Scissorhands composer Danny Elfman (with whom Tedder has shared ideas). Plus, OneRepublic has recently added co-writer and bass and cello player Brent Kutzle to its lineup. ""All he listened to before getting into this band was soundtracks,"" Tedder says. ""He can name every score and soundtrack guy from the last 15 years."" Tedder's lyrics are as honest as ever. Dreaming Out Loud was a pure heart-on-his-sleeve confessional, written mostly before his massive songwriting successes. ""I wrote every single bit of that broke as a joke, sleeping on other people's couches."" Waking Up plays not only upon some of those same experiences but the reactions to them. Take the song ""Secrets,"" and its lyrics: I need another story/Something to get off my chest/My life is kind of boring/Need something that I can confess Tedder explains: ""That's me saying, 'Look, I'll spill my guts for you, but I don't think that's what you want to hear again.'"" Now a front man in full, he says he's continuously challenged and surprised by his band mates and OneRepublic's rapidly expanding, worldwide fan base. But even after accomplishing at age 30 what most songwriters never do in a lifetime, Tedder says his best work with OneRepublic is ahead of him, and he's more inspired than ever. He practically speaks in lyrics these days. ""Music is my life,"" he says, ""and songs are my currency.""";

Ultimately, supporting people’s next courageous step is all I really care about. I think that's what my contribution is — to engage musically, lyrically and publicly in the conversation about my and our humanity….this movement toward wholeness, rather than perfection or goodness, and deepening intimacy, connection and authenticity is such a big part of what I'm here to contribute.” “A song starts with the seed, or the essence of an idea,” she says, and is written in under an hour.” “I far prefer writing about the personal and the micro in a concise way. That’s what interests me. Rather than paint overly broad strokes, I’d rather write about the one-on-one of personal interactions. And then allow it to be a commentary on the more macro effects we see in the world, from there.” Morissette began writing the songs on Havoc and Bright Lights shortly after giving birth to Ever. “Once my son was born, I immediately felt this surge of ‘I have to write this record,’” Morissette says. “Of course the timing couldn’t have been worse. Post-partum is not the time to be doing anything other than post-partum-ing. Because I'm an attachment parent, I wanted to be near him 24/7.” She turned the first floor of her home into a makeshift studio, inviting her Flavors of Entanglementcollaborator Guy Sigsworth over from London, where the pair would knock out a song a day. “It was this unusual but perfect blend of mom-hood and artist,” she says. “It was a challenge to do both at the same time, but I had no other option. I was called to show up 100 percent for both, so this was the only way to do it. i developed a deep affinity and gratitude for coffee and falling asleep sitting up, for the first time in my life”, she says with a laugh. The Ottawa, Canada, native first rose to international fame in 1995 with her four-time Grammy Award-winning album Jagged Little Pill, which at 16x-platinum remains the best-selling debut release by a female artist in the U.S. and the highest-selling debut album worldwide in music history. She has scored a series of memorable singles off her subsequent studio albums 1998’s Supposed Former Infatuation (which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard’s Top 200 Albums chart and featured the international, Grammy-nominated smash single Thank U), 2002’s Under Rug Swept (which also debuted at No. 1), 2004’s So-Called Chaos (featuring the Adult Top 40 mainstay Everything), and 2008’s Top 10 Flavors of Entanglement. She has sold more than 60 million albums worldwide, seven Grammy Awards (and received an additional 14 Grammy nominations), and won 12 Juno Awards. Yet despite the accolades, the one thing Morissette has always craved most is connection. “In my teen years, I thought fame would afford me more connection but the opposite wound up being true,” she says. “Instead I became a screen upon which people could project their ideas, and it actually pushed them further away from me, which was devastating. The reason this new album represents such a celebration for me is that I can still exist in the context of popular culture, but I'm also experiencing connection because the climate now allows for it. Whether it’s through social media, Tweeting, or blogging, it's enabled me to achieve the intimacy with my fans and peers that I've always wanted.”;0844 847 8000

He beams down from the mothership with Parliament / Funkadelic in tow, to bring what is unmistakably The Funk.;Synergy Concerts Present George Clinton & Parliament Funkadelic Recording both as Parliament and Funkadelic, George Clinton revolutionized R&B during the ’70s, twisting soul music into funk by adding influences from several late-’60s acid heroes: Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, and Sly Stone. The Parliament/Funkadelicmachine ruled black music during the ’70s, capturing over 40 R&B hit singles (including three number ones) and recording three platinum albums. In reviewing Clinton’s illustrious career and success as a producer / writer/ performer, perhaps his greatest achievement stemmed from his relentless dedication to funk as a musical form. Funk as a musical style had been around for what seems like forever, deeply rooted in the music traditions of New Orleans and the Blues of the Deep South. Following the lead – and commercial success – of James Brown and Sly Stone, Clinton took Funk to new heights, blending elements of Jazz, Rock, Pop, Classical and even Gospel into his productions, eventually developing a unique and easily identifiable style affectionately called “Pfunk.” Clinton’s inspiration, dedication and determination resulted in the elevation of “funk” music to complete recognition and acceptance as a true genre in and of itself.;

The London-born child of Kosovar parents, she has already been nominated for awards by the BBC and MTV Europe, and was a finalist for the prestigious “Critics’ Choice” prize at the Brit Awards. She also won Best New Artist at the NME Awards, and two European Border Breakers Awards—she was one of only ten global recipients of the EBBA—including the night’s biggest prize, the “Public Choice” award, voted on by fans. Her strong presence onstage (indicated by her European Festival Award for Best Newcomer of the Year) immediately separates her from so many emerging pop acts. But with 3.5 million in global sales, it’s her singles that have rapidly established her as a rising star—""Be the One"" reached the Top Ten in a dozen European territories, ""Hotter Than Hell"" hit the Top Twenty in the UK, and “Blow Your Mind (Mwah)” climbed into Billboard’s Top 25 in the US. All of this, mind you, before putting out her first album. Now, with the release of Dua Lipa, she reveals the full range of her ambitions—not just the dance-floor fire of her singles, but also a more introspective side. “I’ve been describing it as ‘dark pop’ because people have only heard the pop moments, but there are some really dark, singer-songwriter parts that I’m excited about,” she says. Before Lipa was born, her father was a pop star in his native Kosovo; growing up, she absorbed the music of his favorite artists—Radiohead, Oasis, Stereophonics, Sting. Meanwhile, she was still a regular pop-obsessed kid, singing along to Destiny’s Child and S Club 7 (“stuff that you’d listen with your friends”) and especially Nelly and Pink. Those singers stood out, she says, for their “coolness and honesty—it was pop music, but there was something real about it.” She attended the Sylvia Young Theater School until she was 11, when she and her family moved back to Kosovo, a country which she considers much more complex than its war-torn image. “Kosovo is changing and evolving so much,” she says. “It’s still very poor, there’s lot of places that are really run-down, but every time I go back there’s something new and better happening. There’s so much talent there, and people are starting to find out about it.” Encouraged by a teacher who would make her perform Alicia Keys and Toni Braxton hits in school, Lipa began to think about singing—which had always been her “playground dream”—more seriously, and convinced her parents to let her move back to London when she was 15. Living with friends, she made it through high school, but failed her first year of A Levels as partying took priority over attendance. Too ashamed to tell her friends (“I felt so bad, I just wanted to cover it up”), Lipa applied the same tenacity that has propelled her career ever since: She found an intensive one-year study program, got straight As, and was accepted into four universities. Though she wanted to prove that she could meet these academic challenges, her commitment to her music and her vision never wavered. “I always told myself never to have a plan B - I feel like that's also one of the reasons I'm doing what I'm doing now, because I have never thought about doing anything else.” Lipa was working in a restaurant, recording covers and posting them on social media, trying to find a way into the music business, when she was noticed on the street by a modeling agency. “Some of my friends were doing it,” she says. “But I was never put up for any good jobs, just random salons and whatever. And they said ‘If you want to do this properly, you need to lose a lot of weight.’ I tried to do it at first, but it made me very unhappy and caused me a lot of issues, a lot of body confidence problems. Modeling sounds so glamorous, but it really wasn’t a successful thing for me.” ""Every woman should have the privilege to love their body and feel sexy just the way they are,” she continues. “Being able to spread that message and to support all my girls who need to be told they’re fucking hot and that they don’t need to change for anyone inspires me and makes me feel I am exactly where I need to be.” One thing the agency did accomplish, though, was securing Lipa an audition for a commercial for The X Factor—and when her voice appeared in the ad, she eventually drew the attention of a management team working with Lana Del Rey. She signed a deal that allowed her to quit the restaurant and go from working on demos in her spare moments to focusing on recording. “I always had a really clear idea of what I liked and what I didn’t, which made the process easier,” she says. During her years in Kosovo, she became a huge hip-hop fan; a Method Man/Redman show was her first concert. “I wanted to bring in my love for hip-hop and find some middle ground,’ she says. “Lyrically, the songs have more of a flow—especially ‘Bad Together’ and ‘Last Dance,’ where it’s really fast-paced, like I’m singing a rap but I have a pop chorus. That was always the goal.” Lipa says that “Hotter Than Hell,” written before she got signed, was the first time she felt in command of her songwriting, but points to “Garden of Eden” as a turning point. “It kind of wrote itself,” she says. “All I had to do was set it off and be open and honest, and the story just happened.” While recording Dua Lipa in New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, and London, she was rapidly learning the fearlessness and confidence necessary to write great songs. She says that more personal songs like “Genesis” and “No Goodbyes” indicate where her life is right now. Lipa recently concluded her first tour, opening for Troye Sivan in the US and headlining dates of her own in the UK. Other than a brief panic attack during her very first show (“luckily people found it endearing, but I was terrified,” she says), performing live quickly became comfortable territory. “I can really be creative and let loose onstage,” she says. “Be really free, just go for it and enjoy it, and get lost in what I’m doing.” The critics instantly took notice: NPR said that she “hypnotized” on stage, while Idolator called her “completely badass” and SPIN raved “she’s headliner material—catch her while you can.” Perhaps the most emotional experience in Dua Lipa’s young career was her triumphant return to Kosovo for a concert last summer. The appearance drew an astonishing 18,000 fans, and the singer needed a police escort to get from her family’s residence to the venue. “It was the craziest moment of my life,” she says. “Just so insane and so much fun.” She used the proceeds from the homecoming show to create the Sunny Hill Foundation, named for the neighborhood where her parents reside. “We’re going to give to different charities every month for the youth of Kosovo,” she says. “I just want to do my part, because they’ve done so much for me there.” This kind of hands-on involvement carries over to Lipa’s relationship with her fans, including close communication on social media and collaborations with her followers on merchandise design. A small group of dedicated Twitter followers rapidly grew into a community too big to keep up with as much as she would like. “We talk about all kinds of things on Twitter, though it’s getting harder now to reply to everything,” she says. “They can tell my moods from my tweets—they ask if I’m feeling OK. The songs on Dua Lipa announce the arrival of a new force in pop—irresistible on the dance floor, thoughtful under closer inspection, constantly discovering creative possibilities. “I’ve grown a lot as a writer,” Lipa says. “It used to take me a really long time to write a song, but now it’s easier to be more open and say what I’m thinking without having to filter or hide from the people I’m in the room with. Just learning who I am and being able to tell a story.”";0844 847 8000

His videos have over 29,000,000 views and have led to sold out shows in new markets all over the US. Tommy has also been seen all over the United States in his Public Television pledge specials “Centre Stage” and “Tommy Emmanuel and Friends.” About Tommy Emmanuel: Two-time Grammy nominee Tommy Emmanuel is one of Australia’s most respected musicians. The legendary guitarist has a professional career that spans five decades and continues to intersect with some of the finest musicians throughout the world. A household name in his native Australia, Tommy has garnered hundreds of thousands of loyal fans worldwide. Tommy’s unique style – he calls it simply “finger style” – is akin to playing guitar the way a pianist plays piano, using all ten fingers. Rather than using a whole band for melody, rhythm, bass, and drum parts, Tommy plays all that – and more – on one guitar. Guitar legend Chet Atkins was one of the first to inspire Emmanuel to try this “fingerpicker” style as a child. Decades later, Atkins himself became one of Emmanuel’s biggest fans. Tommy Emmanuel is an honorary Kentucky Colonel, a CGP (Certified Guitar Player – a title given by Chet Atkins to only 5 guitarists in the world), an Order of Australia Medalist (AM) and the holder of both an honorary Master’s Degree (MA) and more recently an honorary Doctor of Arts (DR) from Charles Sturt University in Australia in recognition of his commitment to rural Australia and his contribution to music education. www.tommyemmanuel.com https://www.youtube.com/user/TommyEmmanuelTV www.facebook.com/TommyEmmanuel Twitter: @tommyemmanuel Instagram: @tommyemmanuelcgp;

Emerging from the Scottish Folk Revival of the 1960s, Barbara Dickson became the biggest selling Scottish female album artist of all time, earning 6 platinum, 11 gold and 7 silver albums. Known to a wider audience in the 1970s and 1980s with hits including 'Answer Me', 'Another Suitcase in Another Hall', 'The Caravan Song' and 'I Know Him So Well', she enjoyed ten years of chart success as a pop star. So much was her contribution that she was awarded an OBE from Her Majesty The Queen in 2002 for Services to Music and Drama.

His Very Best Of album achieved Gold Record Status and was on the UK charts for eight weeks staying four weeks in the Top 20 and in the same year his 50th anniversary was celebrated with a wonderful sell-out show at the Royal Albert Hall and his new The Ukulele Album caused a similar stir although branching out internationally and broke new territory for Joe in the download market where he is now a Spotify Legend. He has continued to break box office records and recently received MOJO magazine’s coveted Outstanding Contribution To Music Award as well as a much deserved MBE. Joe won over a whole new generation of fans performing on Later With Jools Holland and playing his part closing the show at the Concert For George Harrison. You may have witnessed his critically acclaimed set at Glastonbury Festival or caught him on tour. If you have you’ll already know just what a terrific live talent he is. In 2017 Joe broke with tradition and toured without a band – just taking US Legend Henry Gross along. The two tours and Just Joe Double CD release they undertook together throughout 2017/18 both broke new ground and were rapturously received by audiences who came in record numbers to confirm that as a raconteur, Joe is second to none, and as a performer he is just as comfortable solo as with a band. Joe has a new band for this tour however, more eclectic and with a different line up including among others Fiddle virtuoso Tom Leary; Guitar / Mandolin veteran Steve Simpson (a former member of Joe Brown’s Home Brew band in the early 70’s), Ace Bass player Andy Crowdy and Joe’s 27-year stalwart band member, drummer, percussionist and singer Phil Capaldi. Joe, who now splits his time between the UK and Nashville, combines timeless classics, rockabilly, gospel, country, bluegrass, and rock ‘n’ roll, all interwoven with his effervescent delivery and humorous reminiscences and as Joe this sensational show is a musical journey not to be missed.";

When members from each group were drafted or went on to further their education, the remaining members under the guidance of their English teacher Beverly Hamilton joined forces and changed the name to the Stylistics. After working locally for a number of years, the group was approached by Bill Perry, who asked if they would be interested in recording. Their first song 'You're a Big Girl Now' was recorded at Virtue Recording Studio, a local studio in Philadelphia. This song was written by the group guitarist at the time, Robert 'Doc' Douglas and Road Manager, Marty Bryant, and before long, it became a number 1 hit in Philadelphia and a few other cities. Bill was interested in promoting the record nationally, but didn't have the resources. He decided to contact Avco Records and made a deal. Rumour has it, Bill received over $10,000 from Avco, of which the group never saw a dime. After the success of 'You're A Big Girl Now', Avco wanted to naturally follow up with an album release. Hit veteran producer Tom Bell was contacted and was hired to produce the group's first album. The album was entitled The Stylistics, and from it came 'Stop, Look, Listen to Your Heart', 'You Are Everything' and 'Betcha By Golly Wow'. The success of the first album was phenomenal, with six singles in total being released. The ball continued to roll with the release of the band's second album, entitled Round Two. The Stylistics were becoming known as the Philly group with the sweet love songs. Herbert Murrell and Airrion Love are the remaining original members of the Stylistics. Friends since junior high school, Herb and Airrion have managed to keep their institution of 70s music alive. It was thought to be the end of the Stylistics following the departure of their original lead singer, but as in life 'The Show Must Go On . . .';

This quiet, self-effacing man, this deep, windswept and interesting individual, who numbers amongst his hobbies, a hairnet collection of breathtaking magnitude, has not changed a bit since the early days of the band. In a typical self-mocking way, he attributes his success to a natural talent and a lifetime of exceptionally hard work and dedication. ?As The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican's outspoken frontman, Scott is a debonair and theatrical performer with a half thought-out plan and a mouth with a mind of its own. Can you trust him? To be silly, yes. To be a gob-shite, yes. To behave, no. Like a bus conductor standing in front of an orchestra with a spoon in one hand and a pint in the other, he is quite clearly here for a good time, not a long time. He claims to have formed the band in 2006, ""to fuse the theatrical stage antics of Freddie Mercury with the comedy of Mike Harding, in order to form the world's greatest folk-band in knitwear"". ?There is an element on uncertainty about all of the above, but the rest, as we say, is history. Born in the small village of Hurdy Gurdy, on the outskirts of Gothenburg, Björn Doonicansson was raised on a small goat farm by his mother Elsa Födda Fria. As a young boy she told him stories of his father; an energetic, dashing and debonair tourist from the Emerald Isle. Their brief encounter in the late 1990s, left her with fond memories of Aisle 37 in Gothenburg's Ikea store, and splinters from a Billy bookcase. ?As the years passed, the young Björn took up the violin, with dreams of playing in Sweden's Royal Symphony Orchestra and travelling the world. However, after 5 minutes of trying really hard, he gave up and decided to become a banjo player instead (he has since seen the error of his ways, and rectified his fiddling skills). Then, at the age of only fifteen, Björn happened upon a video by South Yorkshire eclectic folk sensations 'The Bar Steward Sons of Val Doonican' on Youtube. ?Everything he had suspected about his questionable genealogy, slotted into place. After this life-changing and extraordinary discovery, Björn sent them an e-mail via their website, bravely packed his bags, and boarded the first plane to England in a quest to meet his long-lost brothers from other mothers. After arriving at Robin Hood airport in Doncaster, and after a quick train ride, Björn Doonicansson rolled into Barnsley Rock City, where his brothers from other mothers were waiting to take him on the road, singing 'Songs In The Key Of Tarn'. ?The rest, as we say, is history. Contrary to popular belief, on a momentus day in 1978, Louise Brown was not actually the world's first 'Test-Tube Baby'. Unknown to to the general public, this pioneering medical advance had been given something of a 'test-run' by physiologist Robert Geoffrey Edwards & embryologist Alan Frank Eisenstein a whole twenty-six years earlier, in 1952. The early days of what would become known in the future as 'in-vitro fertilisation', was not the exact science that it is today. ?Nevertheless, two dizygotic twin brothers from the same mother and an anonymous donor from the Emerald Isle, were the product of these early experiments. The product of Mr Eisenstein's first petri-dish (labelled ALAN#1) featured some genetic abnormalities, and the second petri-dish (labelled ALAN#2) was placed in a cryogenic freezer for 16 years until more was known about how to correct the defects, and enhance the overall aesthetics. As a result, Alan Doonican #2, was born in 1968 and raised by adoptive parents, pentecostal preachers from near Chesterfield in Derbyshire. He toured the southern hemisphere for most of his young adult life as an accomplished self-taught bra-unhooker, until his early thirties, when, as part of the all-star cabaret on a rather down-market cruise of the upper reaches of the Amazon, he was snatched, and subsequently sold to river pirates, as a white slave, to an organ grinder on a passing Spanish Man O'War. ?After a very daring and successful escape attempt, and with his organ only half ground, Alan managed to join a troupe of long distance accordion players who were working their way through art school. They later settled in Barnsley, where Alan spent many happy years yodeling, doing part-time modelling work for Kays Catalogue, and absorbing the intricacies of the piano accordion, an instrument on which he has since become something of a legend. ?Sadly, his 'creator', Sir Alan Eisenstein passed away in September 2014, and, after the execution of his will, Alan's true-identity as the world's second test-tube baby, was revealed. After this shocking revelation, his predecessor, Alan Doonican #1 chose, at the funeral, to pass the baton (and his tank-top) to his newly-found younger sibling. On assuming his role in Yorkshire's hardest working comedy band, Alan #2 also took on the extra pressure of becoming the 'Eye-Candy of the Band' from that day to now, which is no mean feat, we can tell you. ?The rest, as we say, is history!";

Throughout the past 5 decades the band's countless incarnations created more than 100 studio albums, some 60+ film scores such as the US blockbuster movie soundtracks , Thief with James Caan or The Sorcerer with Roy Scheider. Tangerine Dream got 7 Grammy nominations over the years. Since Froese's passing in 2015 the line-up consists of remaining musicians Thorsten Quaeschning (2005 to now), Hoshiko Yamane (since 2012) and Ulrich Schnauss (since 2014). TD's most recent album 'Quantum Gate' (Kscope) became their best-selling record since 1987 and marked a welcome return to the UK and European album charts - contributing the score to Rockstar Games' record-breaking 'Grand Theft Auto V' as well as a number of high profile Syncs ('Stranger Things', 'Black Mirror: Bandersnatch', 'Homecoming' etc.) have further enhanced a resurgence of interest in the The Dream's evocative soundscapes. Subsequently the band's done some extensive touring across Europe in 2018 and 2019 - reintroducing the Sequencer-driven sound for which Tangerine Dream became known in the 1970s. Highlights included appearances at the Dekmantel Festival Amsterdam, Oya Festival Oslo , a sold out show at the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg and a sold out headline show at the Barbican Hall in London. Every performance is backed by a fantastic light and visual show. Towards the end of every concert a 30+ minute real time composition/improvisation is being performed - turning every concert into a unique experience and promising yet another captivating live electronic music performance.;

Lebowitz’s recent Netflix documentary series directed by good friend Martin Scorsese, Pretend It’s A City, was an unmitigated hit with its offering of a tantalizing snapshot of New York in full bloom, along with Lebowitz’s lively and unapologetic commentary on what it means to live there. For a limited run of dates, Lebowitz will be live in conversation, sharing her invariably cutting take on anything and everything; from growing up in New Jersey and being expelled from her high school for being a bad influence on her peers, to moving to New York City in the 70’s, and writing a column for Andy Warhol’s Interview magazine. She’ll offers insights on such timely issues as gender, race, gay rights, and the media, as well as on her own pet peeves—including celebrity culture, tourists, and baby strollers. These events promise to be a balm in a wildly shifting world, offering spot-on observations about contemporary living and the opportunity to ask Lebowitz your own controversial questions.

After celebrating their 30th anniversary this year, ‘Retro’ has continued to go from strength to strength, surging in popularity thanks to the stunning production level, and all-star line-ups, of the parties. The forthcoming event will prove no exception to the rule, with iconic songstress Barbara Tucker in attendance to spearhead an evening of feel-good classics. Best known for her huge disco-inspired anthem ‘Most Precious Love’ alongside Blaze on iconic dance label Defected Records, Tucker isn’t the only iconic vocalist in attendance, with Duane Harden also set to make his ‘Retro’ debut. After appearing on tracks from the likes of Don Diablo and Ryan Blyth in recent times, American vocalist Harden will forever be associated with providing vocals on Armand Van Helden’s 1998 floor-filling thumper, ‘You Don’t Know Me’, which is sure to provoke a truly raucous reaction on the night! Accompanying the glittering ensemble will be British electronic act K-Klass. Having crafted a flurry of the most seminal records of generations gone by, including ‘Let Me Show You’ and ‘Rhythm Is A Mystery’, as well as Bobby Brown’s early 90’s ‘Two Can Play That Game’, K-Klass’ appearance in Manchester will raise the roof during this simply unmissable evening. With New York-based DJ and producer Todd Terry - a man widely considered as the driving force in moving house music beyond the primitive Chicago sound of 1984–86 - also jetting in to perform at the party, the first ‘Retro’ of 2020 will be rounded off by flamboyant London DJ Jon Pleased Wimmin, ‘Retro’ resident Paul Taylor, and many more.;

The Doors Alive is quite simply the most exciting, authentic, charismatic and sexually magnetic tribute band to pay homage to 1960s rock titans The Doors. The band have worked tirelessly to achieve the same fluid, dark and heady sounds as The Doors at their psychedelic peak. Their heavy and ever expanding touring schedule has included to date: The U.K, Dubai, The Middle East, The Netherlands, Ireland, Poland, Malta, Germany, France, Slovenia and Birmingham. In their wake, they leave thousands of Doors fans satisfied, yet hungry for their next fix! They have incited audiences to leave precisely 6 pairs of ladies knickers, 15 bras, 2 pairs of mens boxer shorts, 1 boob tube and an old scabby comb strewn over the worlds stages. What sets The Doors Alive apart, is their sheer dedication and determination to keep The Doors music not only alive but completely authentic and delivered with respect. All four band members have dedicated their lives to rise to the position that they hold today: The Worlds busiest and most respected Doors Tribute band. The band use the very same instruments implemented by the original members of The Doors. With their arsenal of vintage gear, they create note-perfect musical landscapes that evoke the swinging days of The Doors at their peak. Frontman, Mike doesnt just look and sound the part; with a rich baritone voice, stagecraft, charisma and brooding stage presence, he has the girls (and some of the fellas!) in the front row swooning, and the rest of the crowd nestling gently in the palm of his hand! Mike has studied Jims every move and mannerism to get the role down to a tee. They flawlessly meld the styles the original members honed; flamenco, Blues, Jazz, Rock and Bossa Nova. So let The Doors Alive Set Your Night On Fire, Swim You To The Moon, Love You Madly, make your day that little bit Stranger then drive you to the Road House, and When The Musics Over, The Doors Alive will have broken you on through to the other side! The End. ‘If you thought Val Kilmer was good, be warned this guy is even better. Moving and singing like Morrison the rich baritone clung to the air like molasses - Simply The best Doors tribute band on the road at the moment’ Ron Clooney - Author of ‘Mr. Mojo Risin’ ‘The Doors Alive is the best Doors ‘tribute’ band that Ive seen...

Whilst they wait they while away the time by quarreling, making up, contemplating suicide, trying to sleep, eating a carrot and gnawing on some chicken bones. For his hilarious, poignant and unforgettable play, Beckett created one of the great comedic double acts in modern theatre. Once famously described as 'a play in which nothing happens, twice', Theatre Nation bring their customary wit, humour, and flair for highly expressive physical theatre to Beckett's masterpiece. Theatre Nation is a professional theatre company based in Hastings. An artistic partnership between Artistic Director Patrick Kealey and writer/producer Tom Daldry, they are rapidly gaining a reputation for creating innovative productions of classic texts and are acclaimed for their expressive bold style. Their 2018 tour of Hamlet toured the south coast of England to an enthusiastic response from audiences. The company is also committed to giving young people creative opportunities in the performing arts. They are currently mentoring emerging theatre talents in a number of disciplines: including design, costume, sound and producing.

Multiple ways of making music using only their voices. What they do is far more than a-cappella. They are a band without a band. Having met in school and gospel choir they quickly discovered that they were doing more than just singing songs, they all discovered perfect hyper vocal capabilities. That's why Naturally 7 calls their music ""vocal play"". Every band member has his preferred style or favourite songs and together they can interpret them all. Naturally 7 summon up soul, rap, rock and folk in one harmonious balance. Nowadays they have famous fans such as Michael Bubl (whom they joined on 3 world tours), Coldplay (""Fix you"" is one of the finest adaptions of music you can imagine), Quincy Jones (who called them ""best a-cappella band worldwide""), Herbie Hancock (listen to their H. Hancock medley) and many others. Their repertoire is a mix of their own compositions and cover versions.";
